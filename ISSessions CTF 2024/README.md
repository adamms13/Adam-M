# ISSessions CTF 2024 Writeups (January 27th - January 28th)

Being that it was my first CTF, I was definitely excited to begin. 

I tried a bunch of different categories: web programming, OSINT, cryptography, programming, etc... But the write-ups in this folder were the challenges that I found the most valuable and interesting. 

All in all, I learned a lot and met a lot of cool people. 

So, I think I'm going to start doing a bunch of CTFs from now on... :)

### Hope you enjoy the write-ups for my first ever CTF!
